	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity of an algorithm/code is not equal to the actual time required to execute a particular code, but the number of times a statement executes. It tells how much the program is efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space.</p>
